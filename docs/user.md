This website is intended to help the user find the best location
to start a business in Prince George's County, Maryland. This is
done by filtering data on residential and commercial permits
gathered and maintained by Prince George's County. Our stakeholders
include entrepeneurs and those looking to start a retail business
in PG county, current retail business owners in PG County, the
county government, and the general public.

Once the website has been set up, it is easy to use. The user selects
the filters based on their needs, and receives a number of markers on
the map representing permits that fit their filter. This can be used
in a variety of ways, such as finding areas that have had a recent
surge in permits, or finding the history of permit prices within a
specific town.
